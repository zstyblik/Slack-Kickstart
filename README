INFO:

Slack-Kickstart 10.2 provides automatic installation of Slackware-10.2
Linux distribution.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

- A kernel with loopback device support (Slackware standard kernel is OK).
- Tcl & Tk (Needed to run the configuration GUI TkGui.tcl).
- syslinux (Needed to create Iso & PXE images).
- cdrtools (as above).
- openssl (Needed to encrypt the root password).

QUICKSTART:
-----------

You need to download some kernels into kernels subdir.
You can use original Slackware-10.2 kernels, or any
custom kernel, but if you choose the 'custom' 
way you need built-in support for ethernet card and
system disks device.

Kernel images can be stored in any directory layout:
