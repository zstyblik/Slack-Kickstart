INFO:
-----

Slack-Kickstart provides automatic installation of Slackware and Slackware64 
Linux distribution.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

- A kernel with loopback device support (Slackware standard kernel is OK).
- Tcl & Tk (Needed to run the configuration GUI TkGui.tcl).
- syslinux (Needed to create Iso & PXE images).
- cdrtools (as above).
- openssl (Needed to encrypt the root password).

QUICKSTART:
-----------

You need to download some kernels into kernels subdir.
You can use original Slackware, or Slackware64, kernels, or any
custom kernel, but if you choose the 'custom' 
way you need built-in support for ethernet card and
system disks device.

Kernel images can be stored in any directory layout:
