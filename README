INFO:
-----

Slack-Kickstart provides automatic installation of Slackware and Slackware64 
Linux distribution. This is a FORKED version of ORIGINAL Slack-Kickstart which
brings some changes. 
First of all, it brings support for Slackware64-13.37 as well as script for
building ramdisks, thus long-term support for future releases. And you can,
finally, make these by yourself. I have made some modifications to scripts as
well - mostly clean ups. And for the last, but not least, some of configuration
parameters got changed - some got added, some got obsolete.

Main goal is to have an effective way of unattended installation of Slackware on
machine with virtual machines in mind especially. For a real hardware,
Slack-kickstart might not be as flexible as Anaconda is.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

- A kernel with loopback device support (Slackware standard kernel is OK).
- Tcl & Tk (Needed to run the configuration GUI TkGui.tcl).
- syslinux (Needed to create Iso & PXE images).
- cdrtools (as above).
- openssl (Needed to encrypt the root password).


QUICKSTART:
-----------

You need to download some kernels into kernels subdir.
You can use original Slackware, or Slackware64, kernels, or any
custom kernel, but if you choose the 'custom' 
way you need built-in support for ethernet card and
system disks device.

Kernel images can be stored in any directory layout:

kernels-\
	|
	[dir] bare.i
	|	\
	|	bzImage		
	|
	[dir] scsi.s 
	|	\
	|	bzImage		
	|
	[dir] adaptec.s 
	|	\
	|	bzImage		
	|
	[dir] custom
	|	\
	|	mykernel1 mykernel2 ...

CONFIG FILE:
------------

Unlike Red Hat's Anaconda "recipe", Slack-Kickstart is using one configuration
file. This approach has its advantages(simplicity) and disadvantages(less
flexibility). However it is good enough now.
Copy-cat of Anaconda is being considered for later.

Configuration file is located in '/etc/Kickstart.cfg'.


CONFIG FILE OPTIONS:
--------------------

DISTRO=[SLACKWARE_VERSION]
* eg. DISTRO=slackware64-13.37

HOSTNAME=[string]
* hostname of installed machine/Slack-kickstart
* gets over-riden by hostname received from DHCP server

PACKAGE_SERVER=[ cdrom:|[ftp|http|nfs]:[source] ]
* installation source
* eg. PACKAGE_SERVER=cdrom:
* eg. PACKAGE_SERVER=ftp://domain.tld/
* eg. PACKAGE_SERVER=http://domain.tld/
* eg. PACKAGE_SERVER=nfs:nfshost.domain.tld:/install-directory

TAG=[PATH_TO_TAG_LIST]
* name of TAG list to use for installation
* TAG lists are located in directory 'taglists/'

PASSWD=[UNECRYPTED_PASSWORD]
* password to be set for root user in Slack-kickstart and installed machine
* password gets encrypted by OpenSSL prior to copy on ramdisk
* use of SSH keys instead of passwords is strongly advised
* eg. PASSWD=secretPassword

KERNEL=[PATH_TO_KERNEL_IMAGE]
* which kernel image to use for Slack-Kickstart
* eg. KERNEL=kernels/huge.s/bzImage

KS=<[ftp|http|nfs]:[source]>
* Installation program will download Kickstart.cfg from specified location
* This will over-ride Kicstart.cfg file in ramdisk
* Kickstart.cfg must be named as hostname thus if Hostname is 'darkstar', then
installation program will be looking for '<source>/darkstar.cfg'
* It is also possible to pass KS as kernel parameter. Kernel parameter has
higher priority than the one specified in Kickstart.cfg

AUTOUPDATE=[none|slapt-get|swaret|slackpkg]
* in which way, if any, to perform system auto-update

SECURE=[yes|no]
* if set to 'yes', only SSHd will be started after the boot

AUTOSTART=[yes|no]
* automatically start with Slack-kickstart installation
* automatically reboot machine after installation

PREINST=<script1,script2,scriptN>
POSTINST=<script1,script2,scriptN>
* list of pre-installation/post-installation scripts
* comma ',' is used as delimiter
* scripts are located in '/etc/pre-install' resp. '/etc/post-install'
* pre-installation scripts are executed prior to partitioning
* post-installation scripts are executed prior to setup's exit

DISK="DEVICE[<DEVICE>]=[<MOUNT_POINT>],[<FS>],[,<SIZE>,<FS_TYPE>]"
* % sfdisk; format is used to define partitions
* multiple partitions are supported
* must be specified for each device
* eg. DISK="DEVICE[/dev/vda]=[/],[ext4],[,2750,83];[swap],[swap],[,250,82];"

KEYMAP=[keymap]
* keymap to be used in installer and installed machine
* eg. KEYMAP=qwerty/us.map

HWCLOCK=[localtime|utc]
* eg. HWCLOCK=utc

TIMEZONE=[TZ]
* eg. TIMEZONE=Europe/Prague

NTPHOST=<FQDN|IP_ADDRESS>
* FQDN, or IP address, of NTP servers to get current time from
* eg. NTPHOST=ntp.domain.tld

<NETWORK=[DEVICE=[IFACE];PROTO=[static|dhcp];]\
  <IP=[IP_ADDR];MASK=[NETMASK];><GATEWAY=[IP_ADDR];>\
  <NAMESERVER=[IP_NS1,IP_NS2,IP_NSn];> > >
* obsoletes other network options
* must be specified for each device that is supposed to be configured

ETH=[INTERFACE]
* interface name
* eg. ETH=eth0
* obsolete

DHCP=[yes|no]
* use DHCP for $ETH interface
* obsolete

<INET=[IP_ADDRESS]>
* static IP address configuration for $ETH interface
* obsolete

<MASK=[NET_MASK]>
* static network mask for $ETH interface
* obsolete

<GW=[IP_ADDR_GATEWAY]>
* static IP address of gateway for $ETH interface
* obsolete

<NS1=[IP_NAMESERVER]>
<NS2=[IP_NAMESERVER]>
* IP addresses of 1st and 2nd nameserver
* obsolete

SLAPTGET=<LINK_TO_SLAPTGET>
* URL to get Slaptget
